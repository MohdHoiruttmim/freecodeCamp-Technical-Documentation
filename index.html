                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Write your first program</h4>
            <br>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " +   yourName); } <br> greetMe("World");
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Declaring variables</h4>
            <br>
            <p>You can declaring variable in three ways</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    var x = 21; // with var
                    <br>
                    x = 4; // with assigment
                    <br>
                    let = 3; // with let 
                </code>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4>Variable scope</h4>
            <br>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Global variable</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <br>
            <p>you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="ifelse_statement">
            <header>
                <h2>if...else Statement</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    if(condition){
                        statement_1;
                    } else{
                        statement_2;
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    if(condition_1){ statement_1; }
                    else if(conditions_2){ statement_2; }
                    else if(conditions_3){ statement_3; }
                    else if(conditions_n){ statement_n; }
                    else{ last_statement; }
                </code>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="looping">
            <header>
                <h2>Looping</h2>
            </header>
            <h4>Counted loop</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Looping with "for" which is a counted loop, because they know when this code will be stop</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    let n=1; <br>
                    for(n; n<=10; n++){ <br>
                        console.log("Halo"); <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>code above will be run 10 times</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Uncounted loop</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Looping with "while" which is a uncounted loop, because they don't know when this code will be stop</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    let n=1; <br>
                    while(n<=10){ <br> 
                        console.log("Halo"); <br>
                        n++; <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>code above will be run 10 times</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="function_declaration">
            <header>
                <h2>Function declaration</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A lis of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statement that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets.</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>for example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    function square(num) { <br>
                        return num*num; <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
